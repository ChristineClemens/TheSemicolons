VALUE ('The Old Man and the Sea', 'Earnest Miller Hemingway', 'Fiction', 'This is an Egyptian edition of one 
of the most internationally celebrated works of fiction, Hemingway’s The old Man and the Sea. 
A Pulitzer-award and - Noble-prize winner, this work has cer- tainly become so extensively known all 
over the world, receiving a myriad of critical studies and translations. Hemingway himself could have 
never imagined such a sweeping success for his novel- la, devised while temporarily staying (for a few
 weeks) at a fishing village in Cuba. It is not simply the story of a big fish catch, but it is the 
 story of a touching human relationship between old age and younghood, not to mention its highly 
 philosophical message that it carries. All this, apart from other equally significant factors, makes 
 Hemingway’s work worth reading and contemplating.', '84', 'https://books.google.ca/books/content?id=rl9kCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71nstrPt9UYrsiYblsXBstNzswfOsxOBexTXxFb17OyzUs9GRfU5atDg3p5lBi0aoJfZuWc2kfLbNP0hgOk3hVEGW2GqWWyM_icGVoXAEGLWpyEDP5E6Xd-s3nWitOwggLB3eYO', '2', CURDATE() );
