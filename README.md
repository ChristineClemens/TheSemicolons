# PageExchange
## Description
PageExchange is a mobile first web application that aims to replace the system of monetary exchange often associated with marketplace platforms, and dismantle the barriers that impose a sense of exclusion within a book exchange community.    
 
In order to accomplish this, PageExchange has implemented a credit system that encourages participants to contribute, as well as participate, in the circulation of books shared amongst individuals

## Abstract / User Story

**AS A** lover of books, 
**I WANT** an online platform where I can donate my books that are no longer in use and select from donated books using an equivalent exchange system
**SO THAT** my books are not disposed of unnecessarily and
**SO THAT** other people can benefit from my books without making a financial investment or requiring a permanent address here in Toronto.

## Motivation

As avid readers ourselves, we fight frustration with the problems posed by popular online marketplace platforms that require a financial investment, and library communities that operate on the basis of borrowing. In an attempt to resolve these issues, our team developed an application that occupies the niche existing in between in order to foster an inclusive, charitable community.
 
In doing so, we hope to bridge gaps by replacing the system of monetary exchange, and dismantle the barriers that impose a sense of exclusion by implementing a credit system that encourages participants to contribute, as well as participate, in the circulation of books shared amongst individuals.


## Usage
 
In order to use PageExchange effectively, please access the deployed application at: https://obscure-stream-03506.herokuapp.com/ and follow the explanatory notes below.

New users will be required to "Sign Up", and will be prompted to input a name and preferred meetup location value which will be stored to their profile. In order to gain credits, users can access their “MyLibrary” page and select the “Add Book” option, allowing them to make books they’d like to donate available to other users. These books can be added by inputting the book title and selecting the correct book option provided. Once a book has been made available for request, the user will gain a credit. To spend this credit, the user may navigate to the “Browse” page, exploring newly added titles, or searching for a specific title, author, or genre and “requesting” a book of interest. In doing so, a line of communication between the user and the owner of the requested book will be opened so that a meetup time can be arranged. Once the exchange has been made between the users a confirmation message will be sent to both parties. A credit will be used up once confirmation has been sent.
